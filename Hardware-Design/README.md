# Introduction #

After the establishment of the working communication system from the mote to the gateway and to the Watson IoT Platform, a testbed was designed to utilise the system and showcase its practical feasibility. The objective of the testbed is to take advantage of the input and output ports on the mote to create an indoor environmental data collection device. A gateway (Raspberry Pi with the manager) and multiple motes would be deployed in a room to dynamically monitor the indoor environment simultaneously. The collected data should be accessible online anytime, anywhere, and could be extracted for data analytic purposes.

The following sections would provide a detailed explanation of the hardware designs, and the materials used for the project could be found in the last section, [**Bill of Materials**](#bill-of-materials).

# Design Considerations #

The first design consideration of the testbed is its portability. In order to retrofit a testbed into an existing room, it should be as non-intrusive as possible. Therefore, the testbed should have a relatively small form factor and would not interfere normal functions of, or activities carried out in the room.

As such, the printed circuit board (PCB) which hosts the sensors and circuits would be stacked on top of the mote using the nylon standoffs. The PCB would also have a smaller footprint than the mote, and therefore not increasing the dimension of the footprint. Moreover, the motes would be powered by individual power supplies and therefore not having cable or extensions to the wall, allowing them to be deployed in the room with maximum flexibility.

The second design consideration is the low requirement and ease on repair and maintenance. To reduce frequency of maintenance,
