# Introduction #

After the establishment of the working communication system from the mote to the gateway and to the Watson IoT Platform, a testbed was designed to utilise the system and showcase its practical feasibility. The objective of the testbed is to take advantage of the input and output ports on the mote to create an indoor environmental data collection device. A gateway (Raspberry Pi with the manager) and multiple motes would be deployed in a room to dynamically monitor the indoor environment simultaneously. The collected data should be accessible online anytime, anywhere, and could be extracted for data analytic purposes.

The following sections would provide a detailed explanation of the hardware designs, and the materials used for the project could be found in the last section, [**Bill of Materials**](#bill-of-materials).
