# Watson IoT Platform #

## Prerequisite ##
Firstly, the following apps and services are required to be set up:

Secondly, a connection has to be established between the __*Internet of Things Platform*__ service and the __*Node-RED Starter*__ app as shown below. This can be done in the __*Internet of Things Platform*__ service:

Note that connecting to the app would involve restaging it. However, it has been noticed that further connections established between other services and the __*Node-RED Starter*__ app would result in the mulfunctioning of the Node-RED flows.

## Create Devices ##
It is essential that this step is down before proceeding to setting up the managers and motes on the Watson IoT Platform.
